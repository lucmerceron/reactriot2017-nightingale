# Nightingale description

## What is Nightingale ?
Nightingale is a **free**, **open**, **ephemeral**, and **collaborative**, playlists application made for sharing and discovering musics with strangers around your tastes, and/or, with your friends.


We wanted it as easily accessible as possible. And because the most frustrating thing for us when you just want to share something to someone is to have to register on a service, we made totally inscription free !


## Why this idea ?
We all know this situation when you're at a party and there is one laptop that playing the music. Everyone is coming to it and put his music, replacing the songs other peoples added.

We thinked that it can be cool if every person at this party (or in the openspace where you work?), could take his own phone or laptop to add the song(s) he want to play to a queue and vote for the ones he love in this queue to reorganized it.

And why not, a stranger that has see this playlist and the kind of music played on it, could also add musics and upvote yours, that's a good way to discover new songs.

But if you dont want anyone connecting to your playlist and doing anything, you could also set a password to access it. :wink:

## How it works ? (Behind the scenes)
Nothingale is a simple React application that only rely on Firebase to acting as a "backend" for storing and accessing data.

It uses YouTube APIs to search and serve content in the playlists.
